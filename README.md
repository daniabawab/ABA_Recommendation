ABSTRACT

In clinical settings, therapists are trained to respond quickly and apply Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) protocols effectively. However, parents—despite limited training—often face overwhelming difficulties in mediating behavioral challenges at home. Unlike therapists, parents must also balance multiple responsibilities, from household care to managing other children, which leaves them with fewer resources and strategies to respond effectively during behavioral outbursts. It is therefore vital for both parents and children to have access to reliable, personalized guidance that can help them navigate difficult situations and foster healthier routines. 
Our research aims to design an AI-driven platform that functions as a virtual “in-home behavior technician.” Our research will explore the integration of deep learning and generative AI to model patterns, predict interventions and give personalized support. The goal is to have an AI system which can identify meaningful relationships between the different factors, outcomes and characteristics. Which eventually will enable an adaptive and explainable recommendation. The vision is to show how intelligent systems can complement human expertise by translating the data into actionable insights.
